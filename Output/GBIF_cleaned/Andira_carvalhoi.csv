(Area of 10 km. radius around Base Camp is situated on crest of the Serra do Roncador, a gently-sloped divide between Xingu draingage (via Rio Suiá Micu) to west and Araguáia drainage (via Rio das Mortes) to east. The yet undissected few-km. wide crest is flat or gently rolling with a few low lateritic scarps adn ridges. Brook valleys with very gentle to moderately steep slopes. Base Camp area is exactly at climatic boundary between Amazonian forest region and central Brazil cerrado region (savanna sens. lat.). North-western half of area is covered with the outer edge of the continuous Amazonian forest, here a slightly semideciduous dry mesophytic forest 15-18 m. tall on the upland, taller along the seasonally dry brooks. Southeastern half of area has, on the upland, xeromorphic semideciduous cerrado, in the form of medium-tall open scrub or tree-and-scrub woodland, with evergreen gallery forests 20-30 m. tall along the permanent brooks. Usually a band of seasonally marshy grassy campo, a few meters to a few tens of meters wide, borders the gallery forests, separating them from the cerrado, but where the campo is lacking, the cerrado grades directly into gallery forest through a narrow band of its arboreal form, cerradão. The campos usually have scattered circular groves of cerrado scrub several meters in diameter on slightly raised soil, each with a termite mound. On the upland the cerrado region grades into the continuous dry forest region through a few km. wide ecotone of cerradão. Underlying rock is various kinds of sandstone, giving rise to slightly clayey fine-sandy deep latosols, sterile and reddish or yellowish-tan with almost no humus on upland under cerrado, and dark red with more clay under dry forest.
